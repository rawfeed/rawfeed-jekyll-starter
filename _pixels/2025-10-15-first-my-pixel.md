Monkey D. Luffy (/ˈluːfi/ LOO-fee) (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ, Hepburn: Monkī Dī Rufi; [ɾɯꜜɸiː]),
also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy,[n 2] is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Japanese
manga series One Piece, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires
the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits.

Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since
childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets
sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure One Piece, to
succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates". He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and
befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious
and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing
a range of attacks. In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents
from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body
through different "Gears"; this is reflected in his bounty, which is used to measure the threat he
poses to the World Government, which forbids piracy. Luffy clashes with the three kinds of great
powers in One Piece: the World Government's Marines and its allied privateers known as the
Seven Warlords of the Sea, and the most influential pirate captains known as the Four Emperors.
